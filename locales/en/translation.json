  "application description": "The primary objective of this application is to assist active tourists in selecting places to stay and things to do. The current version of the application allows users to browse and select hotels and restaurants, with the possibility of adding additional services in the future.\n<1/>\nThe backend of the application is built using Spring Boot and employs microservice architecture. The frontend of the application is built using React JS.\n<1/>\nThe application provides user registration and subsequent authorization through the use of JWT tokens. When a new user registers, they receive an account confirmation link. Access rights are delimited according to user roles (ADMIN, MODERATOR, USER). Administrators can create, edit, and delete users, restaurants, hotels, and reviews. Moderators have access to the same data but with limited editing rights. Users can manage their profiles and data, including reviews, after activating their account. Users can also subscribe to other users and \"like\" their content. The administrator or moderator publishes reviews only after verification and activation.\n<1/>\nThe frontend of the application includes support for internationalization, allowing users to view the application in multiple languages.",
